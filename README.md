### The spark behind it:

While repeatedly logging into various sites to build my resume, I became frustrated by the redundant process. This sparked the idea to create my own Resume Builder — a tool that allows users to easily create and download resumes without the need for logins or account creation.

### Lessons i picked up:
-  Designed the project prototype in Figma. While it may not be perfect, it served its purpose. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/HbqmPqGJ449cC0XGR0HJwN/Rizzume?node-id=0-1&t=E4mFiCcP6LmATMmD-1).
- Explored state management libraries like [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Hookstate](https://hookstate.js.org/) ,[Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.dev/) etc, and discovered that Zustand's state persistence feature was exactly what I needed.

### Whats in the box?
- Two templates: Formal and Modern (and you can create your own custom templates if you’re up for it)
- Import and export your resume as JSON
- Download your resume as a PDF

### Whats cooking?
- Draggable sections for easy customization
- Ability to add custom sections
- Custom themes and colors to personalize your resume
